# LoCoBoard
Author: Christophe Soares Contact me at: soareschristophe (at) gmail (dot) com, csoares (at) ufp (dot) edu (dot) com  This is the Project that I ‘ve been working on for my Master Thesis at Univeristy Fernando Pessoa (www.ufp.pt), Portugal. My project involves re-creating a Low-Cost Interactive Whiteboard. So it runs on my laptop with my webcam :) This platform also uses the TUIO protocol to report the coordinates of the detected points (seen by the camera). This fact will allow people to reuse applications that supports TUIO. Hope it will help some programmers to improve their skills in C/C++ and OpenCV (computer vision framework).  Next step involve creating any interface using QT framework for interoperability. For now this project is only for the developer’s purposes.  If you want to learn more contact me by email. Could take a look to this video on Youtube to understand more deeply the concept:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXeqTDklWKE  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd46S6d-ms0  PS: you will need to have qt framework (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads) and opencv framework (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) pre-installed to run the mac os x DMG. If you need to install opencv on mac or linux take a look at (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide).  Christophe Soares © 2009. http://homepage.ufp.pt/csoares/ . ISUS @ UFP.
